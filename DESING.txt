Pecube Execute Analyse preseNt - PEcAN

pekan.conf:
1. will contain all categories related to the state machine (execution, convert, analyze/statistics, display)
2. will generate proper pickle file for every state using pekan.conf
3. habitat state will use peconf.csv file for execution and will write all the success and fail of env creation to the log
   than, punter file will execute the peconf.csv file

    state machine of application
--------------------------------------------
0. contains state machine, logging mechanism, use as Facade pattern for eggs/modules of state machine
1. contains state machine with next states:
    d. pre-execution state (create execution environment)
    c. execution state
    c. convert execution state output to common protocol
    e. analyze/statistics state
    f. display state
    a. error state

2. need to be flexible for adding state
3. work tight with pandas
4. all stages need to have api for execution errors and logging information
